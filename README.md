## CPU-SPEED
A bash script to easily set a custom CPU governor and speed.

It elegantly selects all available CPU cores, requests the user to type in a number between the minimum and maximum MHz their CPU can operate, then automatically applies it to all CPU cores. 

It then scans for available CPU governor modes and proceeds to prompt the user and effortlessly applies the typed in selection to all available CPU cores.

Simply open a terminal and execute the script with "./cpu-speed.bash"
